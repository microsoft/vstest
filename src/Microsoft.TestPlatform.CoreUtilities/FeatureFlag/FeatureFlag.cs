/// <summary>
/// !!!NEVER USE A FLAG TO ENABLE FUNCTIONALITY!!!
/// 
/// The reasoning is:
/// 
/// * New version will automatically ship with the feature enabled. There is no action needed to be done just before release.
/// * Anyone interested in the new feature will get it automatically by grabbing our preview.
/// * Anyone who needs more time before using the new feature can disable it in the released package.
/// * If we remove the flag from our code, we will do it after the feature is the new default, or after the functionality was completely removed from our codebase.
/// * If there is a very outdated version of an assembly that for some reason loaded with the newest version of TP and it cannot find a feature flag, because we removed that feature flag in the meantime, it will just run with all it's newest features enabled.
///
/// Use constants so the feature name will be compiled directly into the assembly that references this, to avoid backwards compatibility issues, when the flag is removed in newer version.
/// </summary>
