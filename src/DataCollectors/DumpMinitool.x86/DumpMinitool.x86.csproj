      This is targetting .NET Framework only on purpose. We want the exe, and we want it to run as different architecture.
      Using .NET Framework for this makes it much easier, than .NET because we don't have to lookup the correct arch of the runtime.
      Alternative to this would be using .NET AOT, but it makes it harder to just build, since you need to publish to get the exe.
