# Contribution Guide

This article will help you build, test and try out local builds of the VS test
platform.

## Prerequisites

Please ensure you have a `.net 4.6.2` or higher installed on the machine.

Clone the repository to a local directory. Rest of this article assumes
`/src/vstest` as the location of source enlistment.

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest.git
```

If you're planning to use **Visual Studio** as development environment, please
install `VS 2022` with .NET Desktop development workload, and install individual component `.NET Portable Library targeting pack`.

If you're _not_ planning to use **Visual Studio** and only use CLI. You will need to install [.Net 46 targeting pack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=48136). The download link has two msis. Both needs to be installed. Otherwise build will fail asking to install net 46.

### Unix requirements

Install common tools

```shell
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

Follow the instructions on [Mono Installation][mono-linux] page to install latest bits.

[mono-linux]: http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-lin

Rest of the article will provide steps for VS and CLI/Editors development.

## Build

### Building with Visual Studio

Open `/src/vstest/TestPlatform.sln` in VS.

Use `Build Solution` to build the source code.

Binaries for each assembly are produced in the
`artifacts/src/<Assembly>/bin/Debug` directory.

### Building with CLI, CI, Editors

To build the repository, run the following command:

```shell
> cd /src/vstest
> build.cmd
```

This command will fetch the latest `dotnet-cli` into `/src/vstest/tools/dotnet`
directory. It will use the `dotnet` executable present there to build the source
code. All the nuget required for build will be downloaded to
`/src/vstest/packages` directory.

Build will produce following assets:

* A portable `vstest.console` for desktop (net46 target) and xplat (netcoreapp)
  target
* A visual studio extension `Microsoft.TestPlatform.vsix` with the test platform
  components required in VS test explorer
* Test platform SDK packages for ObjectModel and TranslationLayer

We will discuss more on each assets are in the [Deployment](#Deployment) section below.

Binaries for each assembly is produced along side the source. E.g. ObjectModel
assemblies can be found at
`/src/vstest/src/Microsoft.TestPlatform.ObjectModel/bin/Debug/net46/*.dll`.

To build a particular configuration, use the `-c` option. E.g. to trigger a
release build use

```shell
> build.cmd -c Release
```

For other options, check `/src/vstest/scripts/build.ps1`.

## Test

There are following sets of tests:

* Unit tests
  * Very fast tests primarily validating individual units
  * Named as `<UnitUnderTest>.UnitTests` where UnitUnderTest is any product
        assembly
* Smoke tests
  * Slower end to end tests. Typically these cover P0 scenarios (99% of users
        will use these, if these are broken, PR will not be merged)
  * Driven by a real `vstest.console` executable
  * Named as `Microsoft.TestPlatform.SmokeTests`
* End to end tests
  * Slower end to end tests for extensive coverage
  * Driven by a real `vstest.console` executable
  * Named as `Microsoft.TestPlatform.AcceptanceTests`

As a principle, most of tests are unit tests (~70-80%), few smoke tests
(~20-15%), fewer acceptance tests (~10-5%).

Unit tests and smoke/acceptance tests are run with the `vstest.console` built by
the `build` step above.

### Running tests (Visual Studio)

Currently tests are run in VS 2017 RC using the test platform bits. You need to
install the testplatform.vsix generated by build if you're using an older version
of VS (< RC.3). See [Deployment](#visual-studio) for installation steps.

Run the tests in Test Explorer. Use a search filter like `project:"Unit"` to
run only unit tests. For running smoke tests, use the `project:"Smoke"` filter.

### Running tests (CLI, CI, Editors)

To execute tests, run the following command:

```shell
> cd /src/vstest
> test.cmd
```

By default, only unit tests are run. To run the smoke tests, provide the `-p`
option to `test.cmd` to set test assembly pattern:

```shell
> test.cmd -p smoke
```

The `-p` option can be used to run tests for any assembly as well. E.g.
following command will run tests for _datacollector_:

```shell
> test.cmd -p datacollector
```

Tests for a particular configuration can be run with following command. By
default, `Debug` configuration is run.

```shell
> test.cmd -c release
```

If you want to run a particular test. Eg: Test Name that contains Blame in Acceptance test

```shell
> test.cmd -p accept -f net451 -filter blame
```

## Deployment

This section will discuss the steps to use the `vstest.console` we've built
using previous instructions.

### Visual Studio

Visual Studio 2017 RC ships with the test platform `vsix` generated by build.cmd. To use the locally
built version, use the following steps in a developer command prompt.

```shell
> vsixinstaller /src/vstest/artifacts/Debug/TestPlatform.vsix
# (replace Debug with Release as appropriate)
```

### Command line (XPlat)

A `netcoreapp` target of vstest.console is dropped at
`/src/vstest/artifacts/<Configuration>/netcoreapp1.0/vstest.console.dll`. It can be
executed with any dotnet executable. You may choose to use the dotnet-cli we
have in `/src/vstest/tools/dotnet/dotnet` as well :)

```shell
> /src/vstest/tools/dotnet/dotnet /src/vstest/artifacts/Debug/netcoreapp1.0/vstest.console.dll /?
```

### Command line (Windows desktop)

A `net46` target of vstest.console is dropped at
`src/vstest/artifacts/<Configuration>/net46/win7-x64`. It can be run directly as
follows:

```shell
> /src/vstest/artifacts/Debug/net46/win7-x64/vstest.console.exe /?
```

## Diagnostics

Try to isolate the failure scenario. In the best case it's just a command line
that can demonstrate a bug. For example, a bug in discovery of tests can show up
in following command line:

```shell
> /src/vstest/artifacts/Debug/net46/win7-x64/vstest.console.exe mytest.dll /listTests /tests:*&&*#Ed
```

Next step is to enable [verbose logging](diagnose.md) to understand details.

Another add a `Debugger.Launch` at the process launch points. E.g.
`testhost.exe` or `vstest.console.exe`. Select the appropriate debugger (choose
CoreCLR for netcoreapp scenario) and step through the code.

## Running Tests with TPv2 using Test Explorer

Test Platform (TPv2) is packaged as a `vsix` with VS 2017 RC releases and lights up the .NET core and Live Unit Testing scenarios.  It currently does not support UWP & data collector scenarios (code coverage & fakes). It is placed @ `"%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\Extensions\TestPlatform"`.

Desktop, UWP & Native unit testing continues to use the test platform (TPv1) located @ `"%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TestWindow"`.

To use TPv2 for desktop - place `testplatform.config` @ `"%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\Extensions\TestPlatform"` with the contents below.

````xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="feature.net35" value="true" />
    <add key="feature.net40" value="true" />
    <add key="feature.datacollector" value="true"/>
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
````

If `feature.net35` and `feature.net40` are set to `true`, VS Test Explorer will use TPv2 for desktop flow for tests targeting net35 and net40 frameworks respectively. If `feature.datacollector` is set to `true`, VS Test Explorer will use TPv2 when data collectors are enabled.
