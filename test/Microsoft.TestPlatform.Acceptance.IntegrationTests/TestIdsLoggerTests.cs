/// <para>
/// The logger only has value if it can be asked for by name from an installed vstest and produces a
/// file a migration script can read. That spans extension discovery, the packaged layout and the
/// report writer, and no unit test sees any of it: the unit tests construct the logger directly, so
/// they would pass just as happily if the assembly never shipped or the extension attributes were
/// wrong. These tests run <c>vstest.console</c> from the extracted package, so what they exercise is
/// what a user gets.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// They double as the worked example. The assertions spell out the property the report exists to
/// provide - <c>Sha1Id</c> to <c>XxHash128Id</c> on one row, the same pair whichever algorithm the
/// run itself used - and <see cref="TestIdsLoggerReportsAdapterAssignedIdsAsSelfAssigned"/> shows the
/// case that makes the report more than two computed columns.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>SimpleTestProject4</c> is used deliberately wherever platform computed ids are needed. Its
/// adapter builds a <c>TestCase</c> without assigning <c>Id</c>, so the platform computes it. Every
/// MSTest based asset would make those assertions vacuous, because MSTest v3 and later assign ids
/// themselves - which is exactly why the self assigned test uses one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// That choice leaves one branch uncovered here on purpose. The seed is composed from the managed
/// type and method when the adapter reports them, and from the fully qualified name otherwise;
/// <c>SimpleTestAdapter</c> reports neither, and the adapters that do report them are the ones that
/// also assign their own ids, whose computed candidates nothing can then check against. The managed
/// name branch is therefore covered by the unit tests rather than from end to end.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// One matrix entry per test. What is under test is the packaged extension and the file it writes,
