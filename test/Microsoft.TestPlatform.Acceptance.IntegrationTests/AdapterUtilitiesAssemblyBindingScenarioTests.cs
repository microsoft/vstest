/// <summary>
/// Guards the <c>System.Memory</c> dependency that <c>Microsoft.TestPlatform.AdapterUtilities</c>
/// acquired when the vendored xxHash128 implementation was compiled into it.
///
/// AdapterUtilities had no NuGet dependencies at all before that change, and it is loaded by test
/// adapters and by Visual Studio in hosts that have no binding redirects. On .NET Framework,
/// strong-named binding is exact-version, so if <c>System.Memory.dll</c> is missing or is a
/// different assembly version than the one baked into AdapterUtilities' metadata, computing a test
/// id throws <c>FileNotFoundException</c> or <c>FileLoadException</c> at runtime.
///
/// The failure is JIT-triggered, so the host has to run <c>TestIdProvider2</c> specifically:
/// the SHA1 <c>TestIdProvider</c> never touches <c>Span&lt;T&gt;</c> and would pass with the
/// dependency completely broken.
///
/// It runs the scenario twice, matching how AdapterUtilities is really consumed:
///   1. As a <c>PackageReference</c> on the <c>Microsoft.TestPlatform.AdapterUtilities</c> nupkg,
///      as a test adapter consumes it. This also guards that the nuspec declares the
///      <c>System.Memory</c> dependency - suppressing it would give consumers a
///      <c>FileNotFoundException</c> with nothing in our own build to notice.
///   2. Against the flat layout of the <c>Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.TestPlatform.V2.CLI</c>
///      VSIX, as Visual Studio consumes it, where <c>System.Memory.dll</c> has to ship next to
///      <c>Microsoft.TestPlatform.AdapterUtilities.dll</c>.
///
/// Precedent: issue #15718, where <c>Common.dll</c> picked up a <c>System.Collections.Immutable</c>
/// dependency that no binding redirect covered, and the break was reported by a user rather than by
/// CI. See <see cref="DistributedTestAgentScenarioTests"/>.
